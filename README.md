# VLM-Sentiment-Analysis

## 🚀 SmolVLM Perception Dashboard
A high-performance, batch-processing dashboard designed for visual sentiment analysis and metadata extraction. This project leverages the SmolVLM-Instruct backbone to transform raw imagery into structured, actionable JSON data.

## 📌 Overview
The SmolVLM Perception Dashboard is a specialized tool that identifies emotional states and visual triggers within images. It is built to handle modern web formats (AVIF/WebP) and provides real-time benchmarking for inference latency and VRAM usage.

## Key Features
- Batch Processing: Upload multiple images simultaneously for sequential analysis.

- Structured Intelligence: Enforces a strict JSON schema for 100% compatibility with downstream data workflows.

- Dynamic UI: A Gradio-powered interface that renders results in a "Viewport vs. Insight" side-by-side layout.

- Automated Reporting: Generates and exports a flattened CSV report containing sentiment, confidence scores, and visual cues.
